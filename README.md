This project is for the accumulation of knowledge and whatnot, just donÂ´t break the git if possible :D 
The progress of the current tasks and the code will be saved in here.
The tasks must be written in Markdown https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet, because it is very easy to generate a pdf from it and a tool like git can work better with it than when we use word or whatnot :)
